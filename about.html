      <h2>About Hamish Grant</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Hamish Grant</strong>. I've lived in Toowoomba for most of my life and have always been deeply connected to our natural surroundings.  Growing up near the escarpments and bushlands of the Darling Downs taught me to respect the environment and appreciate the simple joys of being outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for the environment inspired me to start <em>Eco&nbsp;Essentials</em>. I wanted to create a place where everyday Australians could easily find products that reduce waste and celebrate the beauty of nature. Whether it's swapping disposable plastics for reusable alternatives or choosing goods made from sustainable materials, small choices add up to make a big difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working on this site, you'll often find me hiking local trails, cycling through Toowoomba’s parks, or enjoying a picnic among the gum trees. I hope my passion for green living shines through in the products and content you find here. Thanks for being part of this journey toward a more sustainable future!
