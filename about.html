      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Eco&nbsp;Essentials was founded by a small team of environmental
        enthusiasts who wanted to make sustainable living accessible to
        everyone. Frustrated by the abundance of single‑use plastics and
        low‑quality consumer goods, we set out to curate affordable products
        that are kinder to the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that every purchase is a vote for the kind of world you
        want to live in. By choosing reusable and ethically sourced items, you
        reduce waste, support responsible manufacturing and encourage
        companies to adopt greener practices. All of our products have been
        selected based on their durability, materials and overall impact.
      </p>
