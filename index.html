      <h2>Why Choose Eco‑Friendly Products?</h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable products aren’t just good for the environment – they’re also
        becoming increasingly popular with shoppers. A recent report
        highlighted that online shoppers are about 1.3 times more willing to pay
        for eco‑friendly goods, and sustainable products have been gaining
        market share across many categories【412213153031091†L84-L100】. Searches for
        sustainable items have grown by&nbsp;70&nbsp;percent over the past five
        years【412213153031091†L266-L270】, showing that interest in green living is
        here to stay. At the same time, a Shopify analysis found that 74&nbsp;per
        cent of consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that are
        transparent about their sustainability efforts【358255932475124†L420-L427】 and
        more than half of shoppers would pay extra for environmentally
        friendly products【358255932475124†L420-L429】.
